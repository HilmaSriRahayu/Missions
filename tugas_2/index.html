            We're all scrambling to be different and own our own slice of the design scene. Because of trends and the type of design that we're exposed to, we all end up consuming the same art and influenced by the same design. Thus, we end up making work that looks similar.</p>

                Hey, this is Devon! I'm the creator of 3D for Designers. Last week, we talked about designing for the exciting world of augmented reality (AR). AR enriches your physical environment with an overlay of graphics and data, and is one of several platforms paving the future of design. Other emerging technologies include virtual reality (VR) and 360 video.</p>

                The definition of augment is to "make (something) greater by adding to it." Augmented Reality (AR) is technology that sets out to do just that by adding a layer of data over the physical world. AR can be experienced in several ways, ranging from smartphones to wearable headsets like the HoloLens.</p>

            <div class = "text5 ratakirikanan"><a href="#"><h3>Design System Fundamentals</h3></a><p>
                Design systems create a bridge between designers and developers. They describe the rules, constraints, and principles of your company's design language. If you've ever visited New York City, there's a good chance you've benefited from the subway design system to navigate around—officially named the New York Transit Authority graphic standards manual, designed by the infamous Massimo Vignelli.</p>

                Design research is the systemic investigation of users and their needs. It employs various methodologies that will help you make more informed decisions when building your products.</p>

                Making sense of an infinitely complex world through pictures is not new — Da Vinci's Vitruvian man allowed a viewer to intimately understand the proportion of the human body within a single, elegant diagram. Yet outside the realm of academia and science journals, we've now found our species plunged into the endless depths of data living through the information age.</p>

            <div class = "text8 ratakirikanan"><a href="#"><h3>Run Your First Design Sprint</h3></a><p>
                What if you knew exactly what product to make for your users? Design sprints are the fastest way to learn what your users want without having to actually build and launch. The goal of a design sprint is to answer a focused business question by building a prototype and testing with users.</p>

            <div class = "text9 ratakirikanan"><a href="#"><h3>Vim as a Design Tool</h3></a><p>
                For many designers, editing and writing text comprises a large chunk of our work. Whether it's writing down ideas, editing code, or comprising an email, text-editing makes up a non-trivial part of our day. With this in mind we'll explore how and why we could use Vim, a command-based text editor, to improve our design workflow.</p>

                “Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven't asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.” – Clayton Christensen</p>
